## About

- **Customer's need**: The customer, Coffdel, required a website that would serve as an online platform for their home, food, and restaurant business. They wanted a website that could showcase their menu, provide information about their services, and enable customers to place orders or make reservations.

- **Our solution**: To address Coffdel's needs, we designed and developed a WordPress website that incorporated a user-friendly interface and visually appealing design. The website included sections for displaying their menu items, providing details about their restaurant, and facilitating online orders and reservations. We integrated a booking system that allowed customers to select preferred dates and times for reservations and implemented a secure online payment system for processing orders.
Technologies and code languages used: WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS

- **My role as a developer**: As a developer in this project, I was responsible for the overall development of the website. I implemented the necessary functionality, integrated the booking and payment systems, and ensured the website's responsiveness and compatibility across different devices and browsers.
